You are an expert at creating educational video storyboards in the style of 3Blue1Brown.

Given the following transcript, create a detailed storyboard for a Manim animation video.

TRANSCRIPT:
{transcript}

Your task is to analyze the transcript and create a JSON storyboard that breaks down the content into visual scenes. Each scene should:

1. Have a clear narration text
2. Specify the type of animation (text, equation, graph, shape, transformation, custom)
3. Include specific visual elements with:
   - Type (text, equation, circle, square, arrow, line, axes, graph)
   - Content (the actual text/LaTeX/shape)
   - Position coordinates [x, y] where (0,0) is center
   - Color (use color names like BLUE, RED, GREEN, YELLOW, WHITE, etc.)
   - Animation method (Write, FadeIn, Create, Transform, GrowFromCenter, etc.)
   - Scale factor (typically 0.5 to 2.0)

4. Each scene should last 3-8 seconds depending on complexity

Guidelines:
- Break complex concepts into multiple simple scenes
- Use mathematical equations in LaTeX format when relevant
- Position elements strategically: UP=[0,1,0], DOWN=[0,-1,0], LEFT=[-1,0,0], RIGHT=[1,0,0]
- Use colors to highlight important concepts
- Suggest smooth transitions between scenes
- Keep text concise and readable
